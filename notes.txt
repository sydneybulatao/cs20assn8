DUE: March 17th (next Thursday)

CURRENT ISSUES:
- $ signs for totals and tax need to be aligned

NOTES: 
- cannot change HTML or Javascript code already there
- may change CSS

TO DO: 
- When user selects quantity
DONE    1) amount added to total cost box
    - get qty from drop down select input
    - total cost = qty * price
    - have to put total cost into form input type=text w name "cost" box
    
DONE    2) subtotal, tax, and total updated 
    - have variables to hold all these
    - when qty selected, add that total cost to the subtotal (but add 
    everything again when a new quantity is selected each time so that 
    it is updated)
    - same thing w tax, calculate tax using Subtotal
    - add tax and subtotal to get total

    
DONE - Hide street and city fields unless delivery selected
    - display: none if pickup selected
    - display: block if delivery selected

DONE - Align labels and input boxes with CSS

- When user clicks submit 
DONE    1) verify that last name and phone number entered 
        - verify phone number has either 7 or 10 numbers
            - other characters do not matter, only numbers
            - get function that returns phone number with only numbers left
            - check if length of string is 7 or 10
DONE    2) if pickup
        - calculate the actual time as 15 min + order time
        - get date and get time and then add 15 min
DONE    3) if delivery
        - calculate actual time as 30 min + order time
        - hint: use date class
        - verify street and city entered
        - check if there is something in the boxes for those, check not 
        empty string?
DONE    4) verify at least one item ordered
        - make sure subtotal not 0
DONE    5) indicate validation issues to user
        - pop up in alert maybe or put separate div at the bottom with 
        issues
DONE    6) if no validation issues
        - display popup to thank for order 
        - open new window/tab to display all order details 
        - hint: create new window object 

QUESTIONS:
1) If you had an extra two weeks for this project, what features 
would you add?
I would want to add a section for notes or modifications for the items. 
I think it would also be cool to add the ability to schedule a pickup order for a few 
days in advance or for a specific time later in the day as well. 

2) The thing I like least about Javascript is...?
I don't like how hard it is to find mistakes in the code sometimes. A few times I wasn't 
able to figure out why my code wasn't doing anything and it was just due to a simple spelling
mistake or syntax error.
